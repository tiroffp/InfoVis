The Dataset
</h1>
<p>
I found my dataset on Kaggle.com, a platform for users to post data sets for public use and hosting data science competitions/hackathons. While searching through the list of available datasets, I found a popular one with some basic data collected on the famous <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones"> Game of Thrones series </a>. One file had metrics for predicting the survival of characters, a rich area to explore from a data science perspective, but I was more interested in the other two files, on the various battles that occur in the series, and the introduction and death of almost every character mentioned in the books. Game of Thrones is probably best known for its ruthless treatment of its characters, as its enormous cast of characters and scope of storytelling means it can remove (a polite way of saying kill off) any character at any time and still be able to move the story along, thus heightening audience's suspense while they pray for the survival of their favorite character. The aforementioned huge size and scope of the story makes it ripe for abstraction, simplification, and communication through multiple link visuals

<h1>
Cleaning the Data
</h1>
<p>
Originally I hoped to connect the character death data with the battle information provided in the other file in this repository, but when I started thinking of how I wanted to display the data, I realized that there was more questions I could ask just about the lifespan of characters, and therefore multiple novel ways to display this data to answer the different questions you could ask about how long characters live, and when they die.
Right off the bat, I could ask which book was the “bloodiest” (containing the most deaths), and the distribution of survival from introduction to death, so that was two histograms I could make that would be linked by specific character in each, so each character could have a subsection of a bar in the histogram that, when clicked, would highlight the data on the other chart. Since I already had two of the 3 visuals conceptualized, I decided I could just make a timeline-based visual of character lifespan and have the overall visualization just be an exploration of the lifespan of characters in the book
<br><br>
To streamline the massive amount of data to these three analyzes(The original file had over 700 characters recorded), I first removed all the flags marking gender and nobility, as I was not interested in subdividing the data by this for the requirements of this assignment. The data had death book and death chapter specifically listed, but only introduction chapter specifically listed in the same manner.  Since the data had attributes flagging if the character had appeared in book 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, extrapolation of which book they first appeared in (the first book they have flagged as appearing in) was still possible, so I converted these five fields into a single one stating the book that they actually appeared in.
To reduce the amount of data I would show, I decided my visuals would only focus on characters who had died. I began removing any character that had no value in its death fields, but I noticed that a few characters who had very memorable deaths had no value in these fields, either. After some quick research, I discovered that the data did not classify anyone who died in an epilogue as having a “death chapter”, but still had a “death book”, so I was able to identify these characters and manually look up the number of chapters in their “death book”, add one to that value, and stick that into the “death chapter field”, as I did not want anyone to look for these characters who are definitely dead and not find them in my representations.
Finally, to assist in the legibility of the data, I changed the data in “Book of Introduction” and “Book of Death” to be the names of the actual books in the series, and added a “Book Of Introduction Number” and “Book of Death Number” field that preserves the original data so I could still do calculations on the “lifespan” of the character. I decided not to enter fields like lifespan into the CSV because it would be easier to do that in a parse function in D3, as it would allow me to tweak the formula if needed without having to go back and paste in the new values from my formula into the file. My final formula for lifespan was to convert the chapter numbers from “chapter in book” to “chapter of series” by adding up the number of chapters in the books before the book before the chapter being converted, then adding that chapter number to that total (So chapter 8 from Book 2 gets added to the number 73, the number of chapters in book 1). The converted Chapter of Introduction can then be subtracted from Chapter of Death to find the lifespan

Justification of the Design
  </h1>
  <p>
  For this visualization, I imagined 3 visuals, with a timeline of every character at the center of the overall graphic. The goal was to give the viewer an engaging way to explore all the deaths that the Game of Thrones series is famous for, so I imagined this centerpiece to have a brushing feature that linked to two other charts breaking down the data in other interesting ways. For my main chart, I selected a gantt chart, which has the character encoded on the y-axis, and chapter on the x-axis. The gantt chart structure allows me to encode both the chapter a character is introduced and the chapter they die on the x-axis, as well as allowing me to compress the space the chart needs by finding an algorithm that looks for “timelines” that won’t overlap, and putting them on the same “track”, or y-coord encoding, on the chart. Since the character is no longer purely encoded on the y-axis, I labeled each “timeline” rectangle with the character it represents, and, on mouseover, I added a tooltip that gives more information on that character, such as the exact chapter of introduction and death, and the “lifespan” as described in the data cleaning section (technical note: d3’s brushing system overrode the tooltip mouseover functionality, so the tooltip only appears when clicking and dragging the mouse to make a new brush. This is the first of many improvements I could still make to this visual). I liked this visual representation of the data because it is pretty much the “standard” way we think about lifespans or existence over time, and the reading and interpreting of the graphic comes pretty naturally to a viewer.
<br><br>
  That said, there are still improvements that could be made to this graph. The largest one is that, with such a large number of characters, there should be some way to “search” or at least organize the characters so that a viewer can start to make sense of the overwhelming number of characters. The first thing that comes to mind is a color coding by the “houses” (quasi-royal family with a hierarchy of allegiance) that exist in the series, as that is one of the major ways the series abstracts the characters into mutually exclusive groups that make it a great fit for a categorical color theme, and the houses even have official colors that would make identification very easy for fans who have this knowledge. Color is currently used to encoded which items are selected, but this use could still be preserved by greying out all non-selected items when a brush is made, and having the items retain their colors. The data source also offered flags on gender and royalty, so those could be used as interactive filters that could be applied to the main timeline to remove large swaths of characters while looking for someone in particular, and other flags like a “main character” signifier might be extremely handy in creating a better “zoom” into this data, and perhaps even an actual zoom on the main timeline, with a small duplication that shows the current area to assist in navigation would be useful. A final strategy would be a sorting option in the data, either by default or a dynamic one that could have multiple options to be selected by the user. Possible options to sort by could be by introduction (characters introduced earlier appear higher on the chart), house (y-axis is subdivided by house category), location (possibly restricted to origin location, as characters often move around the world), or significance (“main” characters higher on chart, although this may be hard to calculate as the books make a point of shifting who has the most significance or influence on the story throughout).
  <br><br>
The second chart is a bar chart that organizes all these deaths by books they occur in. The x-axis encodes the book, and they y-axis encodes the number of deaths in that book. The x-axis dimension, book title, is original, as the books can be organized by ordering, which is preserved in the order the categories appear in the chart. This chart could be improved with the same use of color as outlined above. Specifically, the chart could be made into a stacked bar chart, with houses represented in each bar by color.
<br><br>
The third chart is a histogram organizing the “lifespan” (number of chapters between introduction and death) by the number of characters with that lifespan. Lifespan is binned into 20 chapter increments and encoded on the x-axis, and the number of characters that fall into that bin is encoded on the y-axis. Once again, this graph could be improved with the same consideration to color as given in the above two paragraphs.
<br><br>
Between all 3 charts, there is a nice line-up of the axes, as all x-axes encode the number of chapters (the seconded chart simply “bins” by book, which is a variable number of chapters, rather than by chapter like charts 1 and 3), and all y-axes encode characters (or number of characters), making all the charts easy to switch between and read. This also gives the charst a natural way to link, via characters. The charts are linked via a brush mechanism on the main timeline chart, and specific characters are given there own small subsection of each of the following charts that is highlighted when that character is brushed over in the main timeline. This allows the viewer to select specific characters and see where they fall in the other charts, giving the abstractions of the other two charts a concrete example of a character, and which category they fall into. While this is a natural way to link the charts, it would be massively improved with the sorting as mentioned in the first paragraph. This would allows users to identify more interesting trends such as when characters introduced together die, or the death times and lifespans of members of certain houses, by highlighting over those groupings of characters
